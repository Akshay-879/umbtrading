UMB Trading Project - CS615 User Interface Design Project for CS Graduate Program

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the stock market, there are multiple segments/instruments and one of them is options. Trading stocks is very simple and easy as there are only two possible actions: BUY & SELL, where if someone buys a stock it means if the stock goes up it will make money, and similarly it has a sell logic. In the stock market, we have a symbol for stock so we can buy and sell using that symbol, but in the options market, there is an option chain (it consists of a lot of instruments) for a stock or index or some underlying instrument. An option has two types: call or put, call option price increases when underlying moves up and put option price increases when the underlying stock goes down. A normal user finds it difficult to read and interpret this option chain and thus it is very hard for him to trade in the options market. We are proposing a simple user interface where a user can trade options easily and without having an understanding of options.

## USER GOALS
* To get ease in options trading for all the users.
* To simplify the tedious process of understanding and trading in options.
* To get a user-oriented approach and facilitate learning of options trading.
